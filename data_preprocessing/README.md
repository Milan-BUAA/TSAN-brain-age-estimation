# Data Preprocessing Pipeline

As describe in our paper, all MRIs in dataset were processed by using a standard preprocessing pipeline with FSL 5.10, including brain extraction and nonlinear registration to the standard MNI space. All MRIs after preprocessing have voxel size of 91 $\times$ 109 $\times$ 91 with isotropic spatial resolution of $2 mm^{3}$
