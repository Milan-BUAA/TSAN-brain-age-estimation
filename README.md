# Brain Age Estimation From MRI Using Cascade Networks with Ranking Loss

Pytorch Code for the paper "Brain Age Estimation From MRI Using Cascade Networks with Ranking Loss" 

## Abstract

In this paper, a novel 3D convolutional network, called as two-stage-age-network (TSAN), is proposed to estimate brain age from T1-weighted MRI data. Compared with existing methods, TSAN has the following improvements: 

- TSAN uses a two-stage cascade network architecture, where the first-stage network estimates a rough brain age, then the second-stage network estimates the brain age more accurately from the discretized brain age by the first stage network. 
- To our knowledge, TSAN is the first work to apply novel ranking losses in brain age estimation, together with the traditional mean square error (MSE) loss. 
- Third, densely connected paths are used to combine feature maps with different scales.
